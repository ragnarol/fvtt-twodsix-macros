Given the following interface, can you parse the attached images from a list of armors in the Traveller RPG and provide each weapon as an object matching that interface in an array?


If there are multiple entries for the same armor, please attach the TL to the name, for example:

"Cloth TL7", "Cloth TL10" etc

If the protection section includes a value between parenthesis, add it to teh secondary armor section, incuding the vs bit in the protection type

interface Armour {
    name: string;
    protection: string;
    secondary: {
      protection: string,
      protectionType: string
    }
    tl: string;
    rad: string;
    kg: string;
    cost: string;
    requiredSkill: string;
}
