Please extract the data from this Traveller spaceship sheet image and return it in the following JSON format:

Use the structure below.

Include all ship components in items.

For any component with a multiplier (e.g. Staterooms x10), move the count into a quantity property and clean the name.

For computers with programs in parentheses (e.g. Computer 5/bis (Jump Control/2)), add:

One item for the computer itself (subtype: "computer").

One item per program:

subtype: "program", and a level property if the program has /N (e.g. 2 in Jump Control/2).

powerDraw: 0, tonnage: 0.

Add subtype based on the section from the ship sheet (e.g. staterooms, systems, sensors, computer, program, commonAreas).

Use the number in the computer’s name (e.g. 5 in Computer 5/bis) as the ship’s bandwith.value.
