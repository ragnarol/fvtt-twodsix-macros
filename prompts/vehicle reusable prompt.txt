Please extract the data from this Traveller vehicle sheet image and return it in the following JSON format:

Use the structure below.

speed (cruise) and range (cruise) on the sheet should be treated as the speed or range value

TL may be used to represent Tech Level or techLevel

cost should include the Cr or Mcr designation

the skill name should be converted so that instead of the second part being in parentheses it should follow a colon and a space (e.g. "Flyer (grav)" becomes "Flyer: Grav")

The hull value and max should reflect the hull points in the image if they exist

armour will have front, rear and side listings and the value should be included in the detailedArmor section as the value and max number.
traits should be comnbined as a single entry separated by \n for the new line character (e.g. ATV\nTracked)

Include all equipment and weapons as components in items.

For any component with a multiplier (e.g. Staterooms x10), move the count into a quantity property and clean the name.
non-computer components should be created with the name including the parentheses (e.g. Sensor System (improved))

For computers with programs in parentheses (e.g. Computer 5/bis (Jump Control/2)), add:

One item for the computer itself (subtype: "computer").

One item per program:

subtype: "program", and a level property if the program has /N (e.g. 2 in Jump Control/2).

powerDraw: 0, tonnage: 0.

Add subtype based on the section from the vehicle sheet (e.g. staterooms, systems, sensors, computer, program, commonAreas).

Use the number in the computer’s name (e.g. 5 in Computer 5/bis) as the ship’s bandwith.value.
