Given the following interface, can you parse the attached images from a list of weapons in the Traveller RPG and provide each weapon as an object matching that interface in an array?

If one of the properties is missing, you can just ignore it

interface Weapon {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  tl: number;
  range: number | string; // Range can be a number or a string like '3D'
  damage: string;
  weight: number; // In Kg
  cost: string; // e.g., 'Cr500'
  magazine: number | string; // Magazine can be a number or 'Unlimited'
  magazineCost: string;
  traits: string;
}
